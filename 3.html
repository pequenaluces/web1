<p> The Apple electric car project (codenamed "Titan")[1] is an electric car project undergoing research and development by Apple Inc.[2] Apple has yet to openly discuss any of its self-driving research,[3] but around 5,000 employees were reported to be working on the project as of 2018.[4] In May 2018, Apple reportedly partnered with Volkswagen to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the T6 Transporter commercial vehicle platform.[5] In August 2018, the BBC reported that Apple had 66 road-registered driverless cars, with 111 drivers registered to operate those cars.[6] In 2020, it is believed that Apple is still working on self driving related hardware, software and service as a potential product, instead of actual apple-branded cars.[7] In December 2020, Reuters reported that Apple was planning on a possible launch date of 2024,[8] but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed it would not be launched before 2025 and might not be launched until 2028 or later.[9]
